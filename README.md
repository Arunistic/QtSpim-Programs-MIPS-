# QtSpim-Programs (MIPS)

This repository contains various assembly programs written in MIPS.  
Use the `.data` section to provide inputs accordingly.  

These programs may help you in the **MPMC (Micro-Processor and Micro-Controller)** course.  
Hope you find them helpful! ðŸ˜Š  

## Execution
Compile and run the programs using the **MIPS simulator QtSpim**.
